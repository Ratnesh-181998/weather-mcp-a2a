# Weather MCP Agent - Session Summary & Known Issues

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. **TXT Export Option** 📄
- Added alongside JSON export
- Clean, human-readable format with headers and separators
- Located in the "Save:" section with two buttons: JSON and TXT

### 2. **Informative Event Logs** 📊
- Logs now show:
  - User's actual question (first 50 chars)
  - Model used for the query
  - Response preview (first 80 chars)
- **Smart Severity Detection**:
  - ❌ **ERROR** (red) - When agent fails or errors occur
  - ⚠️ **WARNING** (yellow) - For timeouts
  - ✅ **SUCCESS** (green) - Only for successful responses

### 3. **Agent Optimizations**
- Fresh agent initialization for each query (prevents state pollution)
- 30-second timeout to prevent infinite hanging
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Increased max_steps from 5 to 10

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- Model recommendation note below selector
- Better status messages ("✨ RatneshAI is doing its magic...")
- Improved error messages with actionable suggestions

## ❌ Persistent Issue: Tool Call Failures

### The Problem
The agent consistently fails on queries with the error:
```
Agent stopped due to an error: Failed to call a function.
tool call validation failed: parameters for tool get_coordinates 
did not match schema: errors: [missing properties: 'city_name']
```

### Root Cause
The Groq LLMs (llama-3.3-70b, llama-3.1-8b, gemma2-9b) are not properly formatting 
tool calls according to the MCP schema expected by the `mcp-use` library.

The models are either:
1. Not including required parameters (like `city_name`)
2. Formatting the function calls incorrectly
3. Trying to use non-existent tools (like `brave_search`)

### What We Tried
1. ✗ Simplified prompts
2. ✗ Explicit tool usage instructions
3. ✗ Example function call syntax
4. ✗ Different models (llama-3.3, llama-3.1, mixtral, gemma2)
5. ✗ Fresh agent per query
6. ✗ Increased max steps
7. ✗ Memory enabled/disabled

### Potential Solutions (Not Implemented)

#### Option 1: Switch to OpenAI/Anthropic Models
The `mcp-use` library works better with OpenAI's GPT-4 or Anthropic's Claude models 
which have more reliable tool calling capabilities.

**Required Changes:**
- Install: `pip install openai` or `pip install anthropic`
- Update `get_agent()` to use `ChatOpenAI` or `ChatAnthropic`
- Add API key to `.env`

#### Option 2: Implement Custom Tool Calling Logic
Create a wrapper that:
1. Extracts city names from user queries using regex/NLP
2. Calls the MCP tools directly (bypassing the agent)
3. Formats the response

#### Option 3: Use LangChain's ReAct Agent
Replace `MCPAgent` with LangChain's built-in ReAct agent which has better 
tool calling support.

## 📝 Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Add a prominent notice in the UI about the tool calling limitation
2. Implement Option 2 (custom logic) for simple weather queries
3. Keep the agent for complex multi-step queries

### Long Term
1. Migrate to OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude for production reliability
2. Or wait for Groq to improve their models' tool calling capabilities
3. Consider contributing fixes to the `mcp-use` library

## 🎯 Current Status
- **UI/UX**: ✅ Excellent (all features working)
- **Logging**: ✅ Comprehensive and informative
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Robust with timeouts
- **Core Functionality**: ❌ Tool calling unreliable with Groq models

## 📞 Next Steps
The user should decide which solution path to pursue:
- Quick fix with custom logic?
- Switch to paid API (OpenAI/Anthropic)?
- Accept current limitations and document them?
